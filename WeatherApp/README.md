Build
------

The project should be build with the default Xcode function Build&Run. It doesn't require any other setup or configuration steps

Application Arhitecture
--------------------------

This application is written with the SOLID arhitecture in mind and using modified version of VIPER. There is one VIPER module:
Weather. It's a bit of an overhead for the application of this size but it can be easily tested, extended and changed.


Unit tests
-----------

Unit tests are written for Weather module's presenter and interactor  and can be easily extended for the rest of the module
components.
